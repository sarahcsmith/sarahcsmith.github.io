### Doing More with Less: Margins of Response to Water Scarcity in Irrigated Agriculture
![](../assets/water_districts.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
Adapting to less water is critical to a food-secure future in light of an increasingly variable and scarce water supply. Farmers respond to water scarcity by changing if they plant and what they plant, but there is inconclusive evidence on whether farmers change *how* they produce. I analyze farmers' decisions using a panel of 3,300 irrigated fields in California from 2011--2021. I use novel proprietary data on growing practices collected by a large tomato processor. It provides evidence of the mechanisms by which growers use water more efficiently -- insights unattainable in publicly available or survey data. I find that during a water scarce year, tomato growers are more likely to plant earlier, plant fast maturing varieties, and preferentially plant fields equipped with drip irrigation rather than less water efficient technologies. Water access priority drives how growers conserve water: growers with low-priority access rely on more costly margins, such as fallowing or changing growing practices in ways that reduce revenue. This demonstrates that agricultural producers engage in water-saving practices more than is typically assumed and that these practices help growers avoid fallowing, a much more costly response.

### Extreme Temperatures and Field-Level Crop Quality, Yield, and Revenue (With Tim Beatty) [Link](../assets/Tomato_Quality.pdf)
![](../assets/Quality.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
Quality is central to agriculture because of its role in price determination and contractual arrangements. Yet prior work on the effect of weather and climate change on agriculture mostly focuses on the yields of rainfed, staple grains. In this article, we quantify the effect of temperature exposure on the revenue of profit-maximizing specialty crop growers through two pathways: quality and yield. We use proprietary data on quality, yield, price, and grower practices for thousands of fields contracted with a large tomato processor operating in California. In contrast to earlier work on irrigated crops, we find extreme temperatures negatively affect both yield and quality leading to reduced grower revenue in a setting where irrigation is the norm. While the yield effect dominates, failing to account for quality significantly underestimates the true effect of temperature exposure on revenue by up to 20%. We find that ignoring the common practice of selectively screening out low-quality products introduces bias in estimates of the effect of weather and climate change on yield and quality. A back-of-the-envelope counterfactual analysis finds that warming trends over the last three decades reduced grower revenue by an average of 2.4% per year.
