### Doing More with Less: Margins of Response to Water Scarcity in Californian Irrigated Agriculture
![](../assets/water_districts.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
Adapting to less water is critical to a food-secure future in light of an increasingly variable and scarce water supply. Farmers respond to water scarcity by changing if they plant and what they plant, but there is inconclusive evidence on whether farmers change *how* they produce. I analyze the decisions of profit-maximizing farmers using a panel of 3,300 irrigated fields in California from 2011--2021. I use novel proprietary data on growing practices collected by a large tomato processor. It provides evidence of the mechanisms by which growers use water more efficiently -- insights unattainable in publicly available or survey data. During a water scarce year, growers contracted to grow processing tomatoes are more likely to plant earlier, plant fast maturing varieties, and preferentially plant fields with drip irrigation over less water efficient technologies. I find water access priority drives how growers conserve water: growers with low-priority access rely on more costly margins, such as fallowing or changing growing practices in ways that reduce revenue. This demonstrates that agricultural producers engage in water-saving practices more than is typically assumed and these practices help growers avoid fallowing, a much more costly response.

### Extreme Temperatures and Field-Level Crop Quality, Yield, and Revenue (With Tim Beatty) [Link](../assets/Tomato_Quality.pdf)
![](../assets/Quality.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
Quality is central to agriculture because of its role in price determination and contractual arrangements. Yet prior work on the effect of weather and climate change on agriculture mostly focuses on the yields of rainfed, staple grains. In this article, we quantify the effect of temperature exposure on the revenue of profit-maximizing specialty crop growers through two pathways: quality and yield. We use proprietary data on quality, yield, price, and grower practices for thousands of fields contracted with a large tomato processor operating in California. In contrast to earlier work on irrigated crops, we find extreme temperatures negatively affect both yield and quality leading to reduced grower revenue in a setting where irrigation is the norm. While the yield effect dominates, failing to account for quality significantly underestimates the true effect of temperature exposure on revenue by up to 20%. We find that ignoring the common practice of selectively screening out low-quality products introduces bias in estimates of the effect of weather and climate change on yield and quality. A back-of-the-envelope counterfactual analysis finds that warming trends over the last three decades reduced grower revenue by an average of 2.4% per year.

### The Politics of Work and Race in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (With Joel Cuffey & Kara Newby)
![](../assets/SNAP.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
States have some discretion for how to implement Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP) policy, and this discretion can influence caseloads and potentially food insecurity. SNAP policy requires some participants to work, and this work requirement has generated considerable policy interest recently. States can use their discretion to request waivers of this work requirement in areas during times of high unemployment. We investigate whether state politics or a countyâ€™s racial composition predict how states allocate waiver requests, conditional on unemployment by combining data on county-level SNAP work requirement waiver status from 2005-2018 with county-level data from a range of different sources. We find differences in waivers granted to counties by political party and racial composition: counties with higher percentages of Black populations and those in GOP controlled states are less likely to be waived when controlling for unemployment.
