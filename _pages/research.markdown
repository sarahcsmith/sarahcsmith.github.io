### Extreme Temperatures and Field-Level Crop Quality, Yield, and Revenue (With Tim Beatty)
![](../assets/Quality.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
How does weather affect the revenue of irrigated, specialty crop producers? We decompose the mechanisms by which temperature exposure drives changes in grower revenue: quality and yield. Yield is well-studied but quality less so. Quality is critical for agricultural production because of its role in contractual arrangements and price determination. We use proprietary field-level data from a large tomato processor operating in California's processing tomato industry. Data consists of yield, quality, price, and grower practices for every field contracted with the processor between 2011 and 2020. In contrast to earlier work on irrigated crops, we find that extreme temperatures negatively affect both yield and quality, leading to reduced grower revenue. While the yield effect dominates, failing to account for quality significantly underestimates the true effect of temperature exposure on revenue by up to 20%. A back-of-the-envelope counterfactual analysis finds that warming trends over the last three decades reduced grower revenue by an average of 2.4% per year.

### The Politics of Work and Race in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (With Joel Cuffey & Kara Newby)
![](../assets/SNAP.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
States have some discretion for how to implement Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP) policy, and this discretion can influence caseloads and potentially food insecurity. SNAP policy requires some participants to work, and this work requirement has generated considerable policy interest recently. States can use their discretion to request waivers of this work requirement in areas during times of high unemployment. We investigate whether state politics or a countyâ€™s racial composition predict how states allocate waiver requests, conditional on unemployment by combining data on county-level SNAP work requirement waiver status from 2005-2018 with county-level data from a range of different sources. We find differences in waivers granted to counties by political party and racial composition: counties with higher percentages of Black populations and those in GOP controlled states are less likely to be waived when controlling for unemployment.
