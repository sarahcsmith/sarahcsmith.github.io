My teaching philosophy balances theory and application. Economics provides a stylised framework to understand complex relationships. Equally important to learning these theories is applying them to real-world problems. Through my teaching, I show students the breath of interesting issues to which economics can be applied. My goal is to uphold the rigorous learning objectives while also keeping students engaged and motivated.

## Instructor

In Summer of 2021, I instructed a high-level elective economics class ARE139 “Futures and Options Markets”. The class focused on the mechanics and economic functions of markets, including price formation and risk management. In student evaluations, my teaching effectiveness was rated 4.7/5 with most students rating my teaching effectiveness as excellent (5/5). I was rated highly in overall educational value of the course (4.6/5), my presentation of the material (4.6/5), preparation and organisation (4.7/5), and enthusiasm (4.8/5). See student evaluation [summary](../assets/ARE139_summary.pdf) and [comments](../assets/ARE139_comments.pdf).

## Teaching Assistant

In Winter of 2019, I was a teaching assistant for the class ARE172 “Financial Management of the Firm”. In student evaluations, I was commended for being approachable (5/5), organized (4.9/5), and for helping students understand course concepts (4.9/5).
