My teaching philosophy balances theory and application. Economics provides a stylised framework to understand complex relationships. Equally important to learning these theories is applying them to real-world problems. Students are more likely to be engaged if they can see value in what they are learning. Through my teaching, I show students the breath of interesting issues to which economics can be applied. My goal is to uphold the rigorous learning objectives while also keeping students engaged and motivated.

## Instructor

In Summer of 2021, I instructed a high-level elective economics class titled “Futures and Options Markets” (ARE139). The class focused on the mechanics and economic functions of markets, including price formation and risk management. I successfully taught the advanced material to the class of 70 students despite the challenges of online teaching and additional stress induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In student evaluations, my teaching effectiveness was rated 4.7/5 with most students rating my teaching effectiveness as excellent (5/5). I was rated highly in all characteristics, including overall educational value of the course (4.6/5), my presentation of the material (4.6/5), preparation and organisation (4.7/5), and enthusiasm (4.8/5).

## Teaching Assistant

In Winter of 2019, I was a teaching assistant in 2019 for the class “Financial Management of the Firm” (ARE172). In student evaluations, I was rated as approachable (5/5), organized (4.9/5), and helped students understand course concepts (4.9/5).
