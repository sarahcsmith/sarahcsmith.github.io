I am an agricultural economist and applied econometrician with an interest in climate change, adaptation, water use, and food quality.
My research looks at the implications of extreme weather, water scarcity, and climate change, and evaluates strategies to support adaptive agricultural industries.
I use novel remotely sensed data, detailed administrative data, and cutting-edge spatial econometric techniques. 
Through collaborating with industry and policy makers, my research supports climate-smart, resilient and sustainable agriculture, including managing the use of scarce resources like water and land.
