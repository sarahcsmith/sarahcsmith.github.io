I am an agricultural economist and applied econometrician with an interest in climate change, adaptation, water use, and food quality.
My research looks at the implications of extreme weather and climate change, and evaluates strategies to support adaptive agricultural industries.
To answer these questions, I use novel remotely sensed data and cutting-edge spatial econometrics. 
Through collaborating with industry and policy makers, my research will support climate-smart, resilient and sustainable agriculture, including managing the use of scarce resources like water and land.
